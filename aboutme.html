		<h2>Description, Purpose, Users</h2>
		<p>
		  College students don’t have time to keep up with the 2020 election and all of the news surrounding it. For most, there’s too much going on with classes, extracurriculars, jobs, etc. to be able to do research and learn about each candidate in the race. With our web application, Election Essentials, students would be able to identify the topics that matter most to them, receive information and news articles regarding the various candidates’ views on the specified topics.
